# ImageScraper - The Ultimate Self-Hosted Image Management Tool

ImageScraper is a self-hosted application designed specifically for content scrapers and image collectors. Unlike platforms like Pinterest or DeviantArt, ImageScraper focuses on providing advanced tools for organizing, securing, and sharing your image collections with AI-powered features tailored for efficiency and privacy.

## Key Features

- **Private and Secure Collections**: Save your images in an isolated, password-protected environment.
- **AI-Powered Tools**:
  - Advanced **searching** for quick access to your images.
  - **Clustering** for automatic categorization of related images.
  - **Efficient compression** to save storage space without losing quality.
  - **Deduplication** to ensure no duplicate images clutter your collection.
- **Self-Hosted Solution**: Take full control of your data and enable sharing across multiple users securely.
- **Collaborative Sharing**: Share image collections with others without sacrificing privacy.

## Planned Features

### Collections
- Add a **collections** feature similar to Pinterest or Eebapp, enabling users to organize images into thematic groups.

### Follow or Bookmark System
- **Follow**: Create a **home feed** based on collections or users you follow.
- **Bookmark**: Bookmark collections for quick access. However:
  - Bookmarked collections will become unavailable if the original user makes them private.
  - Users cannot add or modify images in bookmarked collections.

### Forking Collections
- Add the ability to **fork collections**:
  - Users can create their own version of a collection and add/edit images.
  - This ensures flexibility while respecting the privacy of the original creator's collection.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Follow vs Bookmark**:
  - Should users have a follow feature to create a dynamic home feed, or a simpler bookmark feature with static references?
- **Image Access**:
  - For bookmarks, images might be inaccessible if the original user makes their collection private. How should this scenario be handled?
- **Forking**:
  - Should forking be implemented to allow users to edit collections while preserving the original? What permissions should apply?

## How Itâ€™s Different

- Unlike Pinterest or DeviantArt, ImageScraper is built for **scrapers**:
  - Organize **all images** in one place.
  - Designed for **offline use** with full privacy.
  - Enhanced with **AI-powered tools** for seamless management.
- **Self-Hosting**: Store and share your data on your own server, not in the cloud.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-User Support**: Improve collaboration and sharing between users.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure seamless use across devices.
- **Custom Themes**: Let users personalize the look and feel of their instance.
